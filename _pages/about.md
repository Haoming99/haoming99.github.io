I am a second year master's student in the Electrical and Systems Engineering department and the [General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception (GRASP) Laboratory](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Nadia Figueroa](https://nbfigueroa.github.io/) and [Prof. Pratik Chaudhari](https://pratikac.github.io/). My research interests generally lie in robotics, ML/DL, computer vision, and optimization. Especially, I am keen on delving into **reactive perception-based control**, **deep learning-based robot mapping and navigation**, **human-robot interaction (HRI)**, and other **robot learning** applications. Before coming to Penn, I was a research assistant at the [Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ie.cas.cn/) advised by [Prof. Keming Chen](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~kmchen). Prior to that, I studied electronics and information engineering at the [China University of Geosciences, Beijing](https://en.cugb.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Yan Liu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~_yanliu?language=en), for my undergraduate studies until 2021.
