I am a second year master's student in the Electrical and Systems Engineering department and the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception (GRASP) Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Nadia Figueroa and Prof. Pratik Chaudhari. My research interest lies at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and multiagent systems. Before coming to Penn, I was a research assistant at the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Prior to that, I was in the Aerospace Engineering department at the University of Geosciences, Beijing, for my undergraduate studies until 2021.
